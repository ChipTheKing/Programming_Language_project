 CPL project to create a Scanner, Parser and Interpreter

<<<<<<< HEAD
Scanner class: 
    The scanner class written takes a file to be compiled and then reads and stores the
    lines of code into a list in the class. The class then splits the lines in the list
    into individual characters and keywords. From there the program checks those characters
    with a keyword and token dictionary before returning a table with the lexeme or character
    with the matching token.
